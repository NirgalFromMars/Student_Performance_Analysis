# Student Performance Analysis (Regression & Classification)

This project explores and models student academic performance using both regression and classification techniques. The full workflow includes:

- Data acquisition from a public dataset.
- Data cleaning and transformation using SQL Server.
- Machine learning modeling in Python (regression & classification).
- Visualization and insights with Power BI.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Understand which factors influence student scores and build predictive models.
- **Dataset:** [Student Performance Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression)
- **Tech Stack:** SQL Server, Python (Jupyter Notebook), Power BI
